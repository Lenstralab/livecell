#### Parameters for pipeline_livecell_correlation_functions.py script

#### This script is meant to calculate correlation functions on a dataset. The dataset is specified in a list.py file (and can be a combination of multiple experiments).

#### specify input list.py and outputfolder
#  -PyFile: full path of input file. For example: "/DATA/lenstra_lab/XXXX/LiveCell_analysis/YYYY_checked.list.py"
#  -outputfolder: full path of outputfolder. For example: "/DATA/lenstra_lab/XXXX/LiveCell_analysis/

PyFile: "/DATA/lenstra_lab/h.patel/analysis/livecell_analysis/GAL1_GAL10_cis_sequential_corrected/20200324_YTL988_30mingal_compiled_checked.list.py"
outputfolder: "/DATA/lenstra_lab/h.patel/analysis/livecell_analysis/GAL1_GAL10_cis_sequential_corrected/test"

#### specify which part of the code you want to run.
#  -processTraces: 1: load data + background subtract traces, 0: skip
#  -makePlots: 1: make plots of processed data (heatmaps, individual correlation functions, area under trace, etc), 0: skip
#  -makeHistogram: 1: generate Histogram of burst duration and burst frequency, 0: skip
#  -SingleCellParams: 1: calculate bursting parameters (frequency, duration, number of bursts, and intensity in on-state) of each individual cell. Outputs txt files with the averages per cell and histograms.

processTraces: 1
makePlots: 1
makeHistogram: 1
SingleCellParams: 0

#### PARAMETERS

#### Processing parameters:

#  -mTauOrder: 0: fft is used for correlation function calculation, integer > 0: multi-tau algorithm is used with order mTauOrder, which resamples every order steps to smooth out errors at large time lag.
#  -scaleFactors: either None or list of scalefactors with same length as nr of traces, to scale specific traces (for example to correct for day effects).
#  -ChannelsToAnalyze: [0] is red only, [1] is green only, [0,1] is red and green.
#  -sdThresholdRed: Threshold used to call binary data in the red channel. Unit are in s.d. of the background noise. Is used to find first burst for alignTraces and for histogram.
#  -sdThresholdGreen: Threshold used to call binary data in the green channel. Unit are in s.d. of the background noise. Is used to find first burst for alignTraces and for histogram.
#  -bgWindowRed and bgWindowGreen: If automatic background subtraction fails, you can use this parameter to specify the frame window to use for estimating the background. Each elements are traces:[first_frame,last_frame]. For traces that are not specified here, the background is calculated based on the region in the track_movies where no high intensity spot was found.

mTauOrder: 0
scaleFactors: None
ChannelsToAnalyze: [0,1]
sdThresholdRed: 0.7
sdThresholdGreen: 1.6
bgWindowRed: {1:[100,500]}
bgWindowGreen: {1:[50,200]}

#### heatmap parameters:

#  -heatMapScalingRed and heatMapScalingGreen: None or integer value of the max scaling factor for the heatmap of the traces.
#  -trimHeatmaps: 0 or 1. Set to 1 if you want to remove all frames outside of the framewindow from the displayed heatmaps of the traces
#  -CalcIndTime: 1: calculates a list of induction times per cell (when the first burst is detected, based on the sdThreshold of that color). Output is written to text file.
#  -SortHeatMapIndTimes: "red" or "green" if you want to output additional heatmaps that are sorted by the induction time of indicated color. Only works if CaclIndTimes: 1. Set to None if you don't want these heatmaps.
#  -maxCCMethod: only if OrderCFHeatmap is maxCC, choose between 'max' or 'gaussian'. With max, the data is ordered on the location of the max in the crosscorrelation. With guassian, the data is ordered, where first the data without a positive peak is taken out, and then the remaining is ordered by the crosscorrelation max determined with a gaussian fit.

heatMapScalingRed: None
heatMapScalingGreen: None
trimHeatmaps: 0
CalcIndTimes: 0
SortHeatMapIndTimes: None
maxCCMethod: None

#### select or align traces for analysis

#  -tracesToExclude: list of traces to exclude from the analyisis (e.g. those where only very few frames are not background)
#  -selectOnDistance: 1: select parts of traces based on distance between green and red. Distance can be set in script. 0: do not select

tracesToExclude: []
selectOnDistance: 0


#### Histogram paramaters:

#  -binSizeHistogram: time interval histogram burst duration and burst frequency in seconds
#  -maxXaxisHistogram: range histogram burst duration and burst frequency in seconds
#  -Remove1FrameJumps: Set 1 one if, for processing single cell bursting parameters (SingleCellParams: 1), bursts of 1 frame are to be excluded.
#  -Remove1FrameGaps: Set 1 one if, for processing single cell bursting parameters (SingleCellParams: 1), gaps between bursts 1 frame are to be excluded.

binSizeHistogram: 10
maxXaxisHistogram: 300
Remove1FrameJumps: 1
Remove1FrameGaps: 1
